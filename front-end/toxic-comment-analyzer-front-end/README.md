- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn installed.

  

## Setup

## Navigate to the Project Directory

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Change to the project directory using the following command:

```

cd <project-directory>

```

Replace `<project-directory>` with the actual path to your project folder.

  

## Install Dependencies

1. In the project directory, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```
